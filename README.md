GET TO KNOW ME 

--Screenshots attached--

This is a first attempt at a portfolio with HTML and CSS. 
As I grow and learn in the coding bootcamp it is important to keep building on this portfolio to adapt to what I am learning. 
Throughout working on this portfolio I took everything I have learned in the past couple of weeks and applied them to this portfolio. 
I wanted to ensure that I had a thourough about me portion, clear contact information, and a portion to submit all my future work as I move through this program.
